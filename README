SYNOPSIS

     use DBIx::Diff::Schema qw(diff_db_schema diff_table_schema
                               db_schema_eq table_schema_eq);

    To compare schemas of whole databases:

     my $res = diff_db_schema($dbh1, $dbh2);
     say "the two dbs are equal" if db_schema_eq($dbh1, $dbh2);

    To compare schemas of a single table from two databases:

     my $res = diff_table_schema($dbh1, $dbh2, 'tablename');
     say "the two tables are equal" if table_schema_eq($dbh1, $dbh2, 'tablename');
